    "In this project, we are going to build a Convolution Neural Network model to classify images into 5 different severity levels of acne: Clear, Almost Clear, Mild, Moderate, and Severe. Since CNN models (or most of the deep learning models) are spatial sensitive, unless we have enough images which cover almost all possible locations of acne lesions in the training data, the CNN models trained using a limited set of images will not generalize well if the testing images have new locations of acne lesions that have never been seen during the training process. \n",

    "For image patches from the mild class, we roll each patch 2 times. For image patches from other minor classes, the number of rolling is determined by the ratio between the numbers of mild class images and the minor class images. Therefore, after rolling, the numbers of images of the 5 classes are almost balanced. \n",

Therefore, we can be sure that images allocated based on this csv file will not have any golden-set images. \n",
