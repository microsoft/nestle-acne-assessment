    "This is the Step 3: training the deep learning model. In this step, we are using a pre-trained deep learning model in CNTK, [ResNet-152 model](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/master/Examples/Image/Classification/ResNet), to extract features from the training images, and then train a full-connected neural network model on these features, to make the entire deep learning model specific to the acne severity classification domain. The features we extracted are from the last max pooling layer of the pretrained model. The trained full connected neural network is stored for future scoring pipeline.\n",
